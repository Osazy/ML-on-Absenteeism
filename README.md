# ML-on-Absenteeism
A large problem within organisations is how to motivate their employees. I am dedicating this effort to the study of motivation, given the traditional approaches to understanding motivation through evaluation are fraught with subjectivities, using the a manufacturing company's dataset. This is the application of machine learning on absenteeism.

This report analyses all the data available from the data in order to predict workforce absenteeism & understand the drivers. The  dataset contains data relating to one company, a manufacturing company in Madrid.

## Objectives
1. Develop machine learning to predict absenteeism - via Support Vector Machine & Random Forest Tree algorithms
2. Analyse which features are likely to predict absenteeism - via Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) on the "corporate-view" of the data by date.
3. Build categories for different types of employees by their motivation - via KMeans Clustering on the "individual-view" of the data by employee.
4. Discuss what actions can be taken within an organisation to avoid absenteeism.
